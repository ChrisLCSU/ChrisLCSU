* Lab 4
  * Lab 4, part-1 was my favorite part to work on because I liked working on how
    to figure out how to use vectors. I was able to find out how to use vectors
    properly and was able to write a program that told you what type of sandwich
    have when given the corect amount of arguments that were all different ingredient.



* Lab 6
  * Lab 6, part-2 was my favorite because since I was a little kid as bad as this may 
    seem I've always enjoyed playing this game. I was able to write code that made 
    a functioning black jack game where the dealer had to keep drawing cards until
    atleast 17 or anything over up until a value of 21.



* Lab 9
  * Lab 9, part-1 enjoyed working on this because it was a project where we worked
    with a mathematical problem and tried to automate it by creating a code. I was 
    able to make a code that dealt with taking in multiple decimal numbers and 
    calculating the average and returning it to the user.
